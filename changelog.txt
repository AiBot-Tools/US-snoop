## Snoop Project

********
*v1.4.3*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 5300 websites.

* Fixed: unable to connect to the Snoop online database on some Windows OS 10.0.19045 editions
(thanks to user @TutovTamov for the report, issue_105).

* Improved algorithm for checking usernames from file and CLI
(inspection for prohibited special characters; phone numbers; email detection).

* Changed the sorting algorithm of the list in the HTML report to a more efficient one: with checks and optimization
(performance boost noticed on large lists and weak PCs, additionally, the sorting became
explicitly ordered: by emoji; location; alphabet, excluding url names).

* Added (experimentally) minimal support for Snoop for macOS source_version
(thanks to macOS user @Nomaleus for the tests, issue_103).

* On GNU/Linux, Termux and macOS, processes are not equally safe: in UNIX-like OSes, processes and threads are now separated
(although multiprocessing with a "lock-protected fork method" was viable and provided high
performance, they cannot be generally relied upon, there are similar issue reports from the
official Python developer forum, on some macOS versions Snoop experienced random multiprocessing crashes,
so for macOS the logic of fast processes was switched to safe but slower threads).

* CSV report for Russian-speaking users on Windows OS is now generated with the field separator — ";"
(for other users the separator remains — ",", for better Excel compatibility the encoding is now "utf-8-sig").

* Fixed the Snoop source version update log on OS older than Windows 7.

* Added a CLI splash screen for Windows OS as well, working in edition 22H2 and higher.

* On UNIX-like OSes in Snoop build versions, the "~/snoop" directory was moved and became hidden: "~/.snoop"
(done so as not to clutter the user's home folder).

* Added Python 3.14 support, help format — "-h/--help" option adapted for updated python 3.14,
added soundtrack writing year to HTML report
(tautology with "help" removed in CLI, default colored output in Python 3.14 in "argparse" library).

* Website counter in build versions, informing about the full version database during CLI search, changed from static to dynamic.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.4.2*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 4700 websites.

* Fixed the calculation of bad_raw when searching a multiple of username's from CLI or with the
'--userlist/-u' option, among which an invalid nick was encountered in combinations: for example, one of the username's
is shorter than 3 characters, a phone number, Cyrillic, or with special characters, where the software filters it out,
but later on the same resource the next, valid username was accepted
(when bad_raw exceeded 2.5%, the parameter was not calculated; now such options are calculated).

* Non-trivial use of HTTP libraries allowed optimizing CPU resource utilization on Snoop for Windows,
resulting in a ~20-25% performance increase in search speed over long distances.

* Slightly increased the efficiency of repeated requests for unsuccessful connection attempts.

* Optimized the auto search speed algorithm on weak single-core VPS and powerful multi-core machines with
GNU/Linux OS. Also changed the upper limit restrictions of computer resource utilization for manual search acceleration:
on GNU/Linux, Android/Termux — limits raised; on Windows OS — limit lowered.

* Accelerated software operation in '--save-page/-S' mode: finding and saving local HTML pages.

* On GNU/Linux and Android/Termux OSes, aborting the software operation with safe resource release is slightly
accelerated and takes less than 1 sec. (Ctrl + c).

* On Snoop for Android/Termux, added notification of disk unavailability and an offer: for Snoop Project
to automatically fix the access error to the public directory in Android OS "/storage/emulated/0/snoop/*"
(If a beginner user installed Termux for the first time and built Snoop from source code without reading the instructions,
i.e., skipping steps, Snoop could not automatically create a public directory for search results and
open data outside Termux, issue_95, issue_96, issue_97).

* Changed the lower threshold from 2.5% to 2% for triggering Bad_raw notifications. Also, when bad_raw exceeds 2%
in CLI Snoop full version, an example hint is added offering to modify the search, bypassing problematic resources.

* In CLI Snoop demo version, added a notification on how to get Snoop full version without reading help
(issues/85).

* In CLI and csv reports, added a "floating" parameter bad_zone — top one/two geolocations
where connection errors occur most often mainly due to Internet censorship.

* In txt report, improved column formatting, reversed the data: "Address | Resource" and added the "Geo" parameter.
In the html report, enhanced the visual breakdown by countries/brackets. In the csv report, replaced the "username" column
with the "Nick" string, and added a tracking parameter for sites with the status: "frozen"
(a rare phenomenon when a resource temporarily hangs:
suppressing the set limits, including at the low level of redirect/timeout requests, holding computer resources longer).

* In the HTML report, changed a button function that previously led to the YooMoney donations page
(the button now generates HTML: Donate/Buy with project support methods, including a QR code).

* Functions: clear cache, update software, verify DB are looped
(when interacting with them and making a wrong choice/typo, the program does not exit,
but prompts for input again with a hint).

* Reduced dependency on the number of non-standard libraries in Snoop demo version:
removed the plugin with partial functionality "Reverse Vgeocoder".
(Standardized the method of self-building Snoop for Android/Termux & Desktop, i.e., localized dependencies
between Snoop for Termux and Snoop for Desktop. Accelerated: building the project from source code and launching Snoop build versions).

* On Snoop full version for Windows, an unobtrusive, event-driven hint about optimizing search speed was added
at the end of the search.

* In the CLI, added a notification and recommendation on how to fix/improve the utility if the user built Snoop
from source code but ignored the instructions/documentation during the build
(the software doesn't stop, but notifies the user and switches to compatibility mode, for example,
if outdated HTTP library/API versions are used with the end-of-life Python 3.7).

* In the 'snoop info' block, 'Recommended pool' section, '--version/-v' option, added ~calculations for computer resource requirements
for normal software operation in any configurations during manual acceleration on different OS.

* Minor visual changes in the CLI.

* Aggressively compressed the repository. The full history backup is preserved.
Users building/updating Snoop from source code must do 'git clone' anew.
===================================================================================

*********
*v1.4.1a*
*********
* (a) CloudTips donation page removed. Build version 'snoop_cli' for GNU/Linux renamed to 'snoop_cli.bin'
and some other minor changes.

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 4200 websites.

* Improved the aggressive search mode algorithm: '--quick/-q' option in Snoop for Windows.
(search acceleration ranges from 5% to 200% depending on the Windows version and PC performance,
reduced RAM consumption).

* Added a new option in snoop full version: '--pool/-p': disable auto-optimization and manually set search acceleration
(this option is personal and can accelerate the search in Snoop full version to high speeds).

* Added a preliminary calculated parameter "Recommended pool" to the 'snoop info' block of the '--version/-V' option.

* Fixed the appending of "bad_username's" to the "bad_nicknames.txt" file
(snoop could sometimes get confused about where it read invalid username's from, from a file or CLI).

* Updated date format in CLI/reports according to the ISO 8601 international standard
(yyyy-mm-dd).
===================================================================================

*********
*v1.4.0a*
*********
* (a) Expanded Bad_raw notifications. Snoop Project documentation formatted and published under the free GNU FDL license.
Updated payment receipt details
(Qiwi/PayPal no longer work in the Russian Federation, removed. Added payment method via FPS. Added CloudTips donations page).

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 3700 websites.

* Accelerated search in Snoop for GNU/Linux by ~140%, i.e., almost 2.5 times!
(with an internet connection speed of at least 12 Mbps, searching for a 'username' using the Snoop full version DB in quick mode
'--quick/-q' takes less than 1 minute).

* Accelerated launch of Snoop Project build version on old PCs with Windows OS/HDD.

* Added a new and smart algorithm for auto-detecting explicitly unspecified/problematic/confused site encodings
when searching in various modes.

* Added more informativeness in the CLI when searching by reduced DB using filter options:
'--site/-s' '--exclude/-e' '--include/-i'
(the number of websites when narrowing search is displayed in square brackets to the right of total DB websites).

* Changed the threshold for Bad_raw notification: raised from 2% to 2.5%.

* Formatting. Improved styling of infostreams in the CLI on small/compressed terminals,
for example, in CLI Termux on Android: added auto line indents taking into account the user CLI-environment.
Reworked the appearance of premium offers valid for all Snoop full version users.

* Updated HTML report:
  1) changed button styles;
  2) added highlighting, zooming the web-list item row on hover,
moving through the list when selecting a resource is now hard to miss;
  3) removed duplicate string/tautology about how many resources the 'username' was found on;
  4) added a couple of mentions in the Snoop demo version about using demo versions/requesting a donation
for project development/full;
  5) increased visual component of country flags grouping;
  6) added displaying soundtrack titles on hover.

* Fixed network auto-testing in verbose mode '--verbose/-v' when tests sometimes failed
due to some servers refusing to accept connection via unsecured channel.

* Removed sound from the CLI in all Snoop versions
(sound notifications about errors and search completion).

* Light builds added to Snoop full version, allowing software to launch almost instantly.

* Android. Slightly accelerated search in verbose mode.

* Android. If a user prefers to open html reports manually and from their GUI FM,
all styles are now also loaded.

* Updated 'GEO_IP/domain' and 'ReverseVgeocoder' plugins to new versions. Expanded data visualization
in html reports in Snoop full versions, specifically added:
  1) checkbox for filtering data by countries;
  2) graphs with statistics by countries, regions, objects, providers;
  3) a new layer — topomaps, changes by click/swipe;
  4) full screen toggle mode;
  5) auto coordinate display at any point on the map;
  6) ruler scale;
  7) a memo displaying statistics on InvalidData;
  8) copyright;
  9) search;
  10) in the 'ReverseVgeocoder' plugin, coverage scale/accuracy was increased by 10-100 times by okrugs/objects
in RU, EU, and CIS locations.

! To take advantage of all updates, if the user previously used old Snoop builds,
they need to clear the cache (one-time operation):
$ snoop_cli --autoclean
if the user preferred to use Snoop in source form, update the libraries:
$ cd ~/snoop && python3 -m pip install -r requirements_android.txt  #Android;
$ cd ~/snoop && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  #Desktop.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.9*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 3500 websites.

* Fixed a memory leak affecting Snoop version for Windows users.

* Fixed Snoop crashing when saving reports with '--save-page/-S' option in extremely rare cases
(e.g., if websites deliberately harmed parsing or their source code contained unsupported characters
in the declared encoding. Thanks to a subscriber from Serbia for the report, who previously sent info on found bugs).

* Added a new metric to verbose mode option '--verbose/-v': tracking available/consumed RAM memory.

* Sped up the printing of sites from the "dynamic gray list" and invalid/Cyrillic "nickname(s)" on certain sites
(optimization is relevant for Snoop for Windows full version users).

* Added an easter egg to Snoop Project software related to searching for special nickname(s).

* Hid rarely used options from help: '--cert/-C' and 'Headers/-H' so as not to clutter the help
(options continue to work if invoked, key description remains in documentation and readme).

* Added "copyright" to all reports.

* Merged branches "snoop_termux" and "master", slightly changed instructions for installing Snoop on Android/Termux
(code synchronized, saving disk space and simplifying further development/maintenance of the codebase.
To get updates from "source code", Snoop for OS Android/Termux users must do
"git checkout master" or "git clone" anew).

* Merged country flags Kb/WR
(WR — means whole world. Kb — previously meant "cyberpunks", usually these are forums where communication takes place in EN-language,
but the terms of use or privacy policy/feedback do not indicate a location).

* Updated documentation.

* Minor visual improvements.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.8*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to over 3000 websites.

* Fixed bugs in rare cases:
  1) searching nickname with the option to save reports 'snoop_cli -S username', if searching on a "bad" resource
username found, but the server specifies a non-existent encoding or encoding with a typo, then when saving
the page broke auto-detect encoding in snoop;
  2) when searching for nickname, multiprocessing on Snoop for GNU/Linux full version could and did crash
(it was almost impossible to reproduce the problem, thanks to a Snoop full version subscriber from Serbia for the reports).

* Expanded the template for prohibited characters when searching for a nickname, e.g., the Chinese alphabet and other
characters different from Latin, Cyrillic, numbers, certain special characters — are now disallowed.

* When using the 'userlist/-u' option (loading nickname(s) from file) an intermediate table is added to the cli report:
short nickname(s). Also the 'bad_nicknames.txt' file updates if 'incorrect' nicknames were entered
not only in CLI but also unloaded from file: 'bad_nicknames.txt' format looks as follows::
date/time/incorrect nickname from file/or from CLI/bad_username.

* Yandex joined internet censorship and now emails from its domain are not sent to the international postal service
'protonmail', for users registered in 'yandex/mailru' who previously could not contact the developer
via email, an additional uncensored email for inquiries and suggestions is added to the Snoop offer and documentation.

* Changed terms of provision for Snoop full version for students: software discount is now 50%,
previously subscription cost 0 rub., also Sberbank card details updated.

* Added Readme in Spanish, Chinese, French, and German.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.7*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to 2700 websites.

* Android. Accelerated snoop search on Termux by ~200%
(requires Termux update and Python update to version 3.11, or installation of patched python 3.7-3.10 from
tur-repo, in extreme case backward compatibility and non-fast search is preserved).

* Android. [Due to specific locale in Termux] if user searches for a nickname, e.g., in Cyrillic,
only in html results the nickname will be renamed as 'nickname_h_m_y_time', a measure necessary for correct
autoplay search results in web browser, txt/csv reports unaffected.

* Reworked and improved intelligent search logic. Snoop in most cases does not make repeat requests
to resources censored by external party or internal regulator
(saving search time, otherwise, resources would be wasted, relevant in Full versions).

* Improved detection of three groups of sites:
  1. false positives are excluded when searching, if problems with servers or they are on maintenance, affects ~50% of Snoop DB;
  2. more results when searching on sites that have long been abandoned or have security issues;
  3. expanded Snoop DB format for operations with rare problematic encodings/sites, e.g., when the server
returns/does not return one encoding, but tags contain another.

* Fixed the % Bad_raw calculation for any operations with Snoop DB, also taking into account sites from Dynamic gray_list
(default local DB; downloaded DB; synchronized online DB; reduced DBs with keys '-s', '-i', '-e').

* Added typo check: nickname cannot be shorter than 3 characters
(if the user made a typo, for example when typing key '-s': "$ snoop_cli - s ebay username", behavior previously
would invoke a search of exactly four nickname(s) across the entire snoop DB:: '-', 's', 'ebay', 'username' instead of searching
one username on one specified resource — ebay.com).

* Added a new search option: mode '--quick/-q', which speeds up the general search
(more details about the new search mode in '--help/-h', quick mode is relevant for Full versions, on weak capacities, Windows OS).

* Reworked the codebase of some parts of the software, the project has fewer third-party lib dependencies.

* Cosmetic changes to the software
(removed 'Normal' option; 'one-level' option renamed to 'include'; report deletion option now outputs a banner and
prompts confirmation for deletion; logging low/high errors is more informative;
expanded the snoop-info block; when searching for nickname and getting errors in CLI related to Internet Censorship/ssl,
the country code appears to the right of the resource, for example, if users from RU location very often encounter
errors on UA resources, it means "the elephant in the room"; project support is now possible via QIWI;
fixed print typos and semantic structures).
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.6*
********
* Updated the GEO_IP/domain plugin. If the target is non-existent or not found, the software automatically interrupts the program
(on some Android versions Snoop could unexpectedly hang for ~a minute. Updated spinner: a rotating planet).

* The default value of the "-t" timeout option when searching for "nickname" raised to 9 sec.
(previous value = 5 sec. Reason: snoop demo DB increase).

* When searching for "nickname", retries added for connection failures on problematic resources
(on some unsuccessful connection attempts, request retries are sent,
partial functionality ported from Full versions).

* Key combination: "ctrl + c" — now equally well interrupts software execution in all Snoop versions and on different OS.

* Searching for "nickname" on Snoop for GNU/Linux in demo became faster compared to searching on Snoop for Windows demo
(partial functionality ported from Full versions).

* The "-C" option reversed on Snoop for Android.
(when searching for "nickname" checking certificates is now disabled by default everywhere including Android OS,
effect — fewer errors on problematic sites. Example reproduction of problem with "bad site":
$ snoop_cli -s forumkinopoisk nickname123321 -C
in early Python versions disabling "certificate check" only on Snoop for Android caused search slowdown).

* Hid the '--base/-b' option
(the least frequently used option hidden so as not to clutter the "help").

* The snoop-info block, "snoop -V" option highlights the RAM parameter when PC/smartphone programs have captured "all" memory
(if Snoop considers there is not enough RAM for normal operation, on different OS these values are unequal,
it highlights the available RAM in OS in red).

* Minor cosmetic changes.

* Updated documentation: 'General Guide Snoop Project.pdf'.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.5*
********
* Updated the GEO_IP/domain plugin. The old method of checking ip/domains broke and was replaced with three new ones.
In case of failure of one method, the next one is picked up. Checks updated in the logic and a spinner added.

* In build versions, some libraries updated, surprises may appear (see snoop_cli -V).

* Build versions 'snoop' renamed to 'snoop_cli'
(for users who didn't read the documentation and tried to run 'snoop' from home directory in GNU/Linux).

* Reduced installation time for Snoop on Android (Termux) by several times.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.4*
********
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search > 2600+ websites, 54% of which are in the ru-zone.

* Dynamic temporarily disabled websites from "Graylist" now displayed in "Websites.md": marks (g. l.).

* Auto-opening of results in an external web browser fixed on all Android versions without config edits
(detection of Android distros ("snoop -V -> snoop info" and auto-opening of search results in "HTML Viewer").

* Fix for creating tabular csv reports on Windows OS for locales/encodings other than RU (issues/61).

* Updated Reverse Vgeocoder & GEO_IP/domain plugins: marker popups became more informative
(full versions).

* Removed and no longer supported English snoop build versions
(removed and no longer supported English snoop build versions).

* Minor fixes.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.3*
********
* Added video tutorials in archives for quick snoop launch for beginner users who haven't worked with CLI
(issues/48).

* Added txt report: 'bad_nicknames.txt' file where skipped date/nickname(s) are recorded
(invalid nicknames/phones/certain_special_characters, updating the file in append mode during search, e.g. with the '-u' option.

* Added a mode for gracefully stopping the software with resource release for different versions/platforms of Snoop Project (ctrl+c).

* Added a new option '--headers/-H': manually set a custom user-agent.
By default, a random but real user-agent is generated for each site or selected/overridden from the Snoop DB
with an expanded header to bypass some 'CF protections'.

* Added a snoop splash screen and some emojis when nickname(s) for search are not specified or contradictory parameters
are chosen in the CLI arguments
(exception: snoop for Windows OS — old CLI OS Windows 7).

* Added various info panels: DB display '--list-all/-l'; verbose mode; new 'snoop-info' block
with '--version/-V' option; with '--userlist/-u' option division into nickname(s) groups:
valid/invalid/duplicates; in Yandex_parser CLI (full versions).

* Updated search mode with '--userlist/-u' option expanded algorithm for detecting nickname(s)/email
(just try to use it again).

* Accelerated DB output in CLI for '--list-all/-l' option methods [1/2].

* For Snoop for Termux (Android) added auto-opening of search results in external browser
without overlapping results in CLI
(at user's explicit request, opening results in an external web browser can be ignored).

* Updated UI for search results in CLI when searching nickname(s). Updated license output in Windows XP style. 
Updated progress (previously progress updated as data arrived, making software appear to hang in full versions).
Progress updates several times/sec. or as data arrives in verbose mode.

* In html reports added a new 'Doc' button leading to documentation 'General Guide Snoop Project.pdf'/online.

* In txt reports, just like in html/csv reports, added 'session' parameter.

* Updated all Snoop Project options closer to POSIX (see snoop --help).
Old variant of using arguments in CLI with confirmation [y] is backward compatible.

* Updated Yandex_parser to v0.5: removed Y.Collections service (resource inactive).
Added Y.Avatar: login/email. In multi-user mode in txt/cli/html reports added/updated metrics:
'valid_logins/unregistered_users/unprocessed_data/duplicates', login labels.

* Subdirectories for saved reports/results are grouped: plugin(s) in one directory, nickname(s) in another.

* Fixed graceful software exit when trying to test network during absence/failure with '-v' option.

* Fixed in CLI: indiv.session/traffic/time when searching multiple names in one session
with '-u' option and/or '-v' option.

* Fixed in csv reports: site response time is separated by 'correct fractional sign'::
dot or comma based on user locale (i.e. the number in table is always a digit regardless of fractional sign,
which directly affects result sorting by parameter).
Data below 1 KB rounded more accurately, above 1 KB without fractional part. Total time (was in ms, now in sec.hundredths).
When saving reports with '-S' option or in regular mode for sites
using specific method for detecting nickname(s):
(username.salt) the session data size is now also calculated.

* Migration of Snoop Project build versions from python3.7 to python3.8 (except EN versions).
===================================================================================

********
*v1.3.2*
********
* Expanded DB format: added "grey_list" parameter for temporarily disabled dynamic sites.
(status of temporarily disabled sites is written to csv reports, 
with '--verbose/-v' option, info about sites from grey_list is also displayed in CLI).

* For Snoop build versions added a spinner during sync of local and remote DB
(during DB sync/update a temporarily animated message pops up: 'synchronizing with online DB').

* At the request of a donator, updated the '--list all' option displaying detailed info about snoop DB to abbreviation '-l y'.

* Added a new option '--exclude/-e' to exclude selected regions from search, e.g. '-e WR' — exclude world
(can use option multiple times '-e ru -e us'. Option is case-insensitive, country flag info
is displayed in cli and written to all reports. Non-existent, selected regions highlighted in red in CLI).

* Added '--one-level/-o' option, include specific regions for search
(can use option multiple times, e.g. search only on Ukrainian and Belarusian sites '-o UA -o BY'.
Option — case-insensitive, country flag info also added to cli and all reports, 
non-existent, selected regions highlighted in red in CLI).

* The '--site/-s' option now also outputs messages if the desired search site is seen in Full version DB,
but missing from Demo version DB.

* Fixed permissions for documentation in archives: 'General Guide Snoop Project.pdf'.
(from 755 to 644).

* Updated help in software 'snoop --help'.

* Minor and insignificant improvements in codebase.
===================================================================================

************
*v1.3.1 (A)*
************
* Expanded the Snoop web-base search > 2200+ websites.

* Added to html/csv reports and CLI parameter: 'session':: processed traffic data (ungzip)
overall and individually for each site
(with '-v' option visually in CLI; new 'Session/Kb' column in csv report; 'session' in html report).

* When exceeding standard Internet Censorship parameters
in general CLI output added info on omissions: err DB in '%'.

* Updated Yandex_parser plugin to v0.4 
(skips data processing for non-existent usernames in Yandex DB).

* Changed report write paths for Snoop for Windows (issues/49).

* Updated permissions for Snoop for GNU/Linux build versions from 744 to 644 (issues/50).

* Changed utf-8 encoding of csv reports to automatic encoding selection (for Windows OS: 1251).

(Changed appearance (especially/now) will be noticeable by Snoop for Windows users,
many things will automatically adjust to console size for all OS).

* Added parameters to progress: spinner and elapsed time.

* At the request of a donator, updated option '-f': 'print only found accounts'
(previously option '-f' printed found accounts and captcha/err notifications, service and 
user notifications in this mode are now suppressed).

* Updated '-v' option - detailed verbose
(output became more readable).

* All Snoop plugins updated to following versions
(fixed some errors related to specific paths and special characters,
removed 'Ya Region' from 'Yandex_parser' plugin due to service closure. In GEO_IP/domain plugin
added 'Offline_quiet search' mode, sorting by values added to tables).

Changes affected all Snoop versions 6 out of 10 programs (Snoop for Termux/Source;
Windows/Linux/Demo/Full/RU/Build) except EN versions. Further maintenance and development of EN versions
ceased (Latest Snoop/EN/Build versions v1.2.8).
===================================================================================

********
*v1.2.8*
********
* Accelerated search by 'username' by ~100% for Snoop for Termux.

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search > 1500+ websites.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.2.7*
********
* Updated Reverse Vgeocoder plugin to v0.2
(added geocoding method: 'Detailed'. This method includes:
all markers labeled with geotags; countries; okrugs and cities. 
Added statistical reports {with extended geoinfo, as well as quantitative calculation 
of percentage ratio}, which are saved with details in [txt.html.csv] formats.
Added: status bar; geocoding completion percentage. More details about plugin in help or documentation).

* Updated Yandex_parser plugin to v0.2
(Added search and link via 'Yandex_reviews' service).

********
* Added 'Yandex_parser' plugin to Snoop Project
(more details about the plugin in the help or documentation).

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to 1349 websites.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.2.4*
********
* Added two plugins to Snoop Project: 'GEO_IP/domain' and 'Reverse Vgeocoder'.
(calling plugins, for example, for compiling Snoop for Windows 'snoop.exe --module y'.
  1. The 'GEO_IP/domain' plugin allows working with IPv4/v6/domain/url as a target,
provides statistical and visualized reports in CLI/txt/csv/maps.
  2. The 'Reverse Vgeocoder' plugin is a simple reverse geocoder).
More details about plugins in Snoop Project help or documentation.

* Created a separate branch for Snoop for Termux.
(Snoop for Termux has software limitations and cannot work with one
plugin: Reverse Vgeocoder).

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to 1330 websites.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.2.3*
********
* Added '--cert-on/-C' option.
(Turns on certificate checking on servers. By default, certificate checking on
servers is disabled, which yields fewer errors and more positive results when
searching for "username". Example: website:: 'Forumkinopoisk' with a "problematic" certificate).

* Expanded the Snoop web-base search to 1220 websites.
===================================================================================

********
*v1.2.2*
********
* Added 'SNOOPninja' mode for Snoop for GNU/Linux.
('SNOOPninja' search mode is enabled by default in Snoop Full Version:
search acceleration ~25% (in tandem with '--no-func/-n' option search accelerates by ~50%);
RAM savings ~50%; repeated 'flexible connections' on 'problematic' resources).
For Snoop for Windows added ability:
(repeated 'flexible connections' on 'problematic' resources).

* Added option for Snoop for GNU/Linux Full version: '--normal/-N':
(mode change:: SNOOPninja > normal search mode).
